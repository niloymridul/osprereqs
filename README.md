Welcome to the osTicket tutorial. This part of the tutorial will be detailing the setup of osTicket.

Before start installing, let's talk about osTicket, what is does, and why we need it. osTicket is a popular open-source support ticket system. 

Open source means that the source is made for anyone to use or alter and distribute as they see fit. 

A support ticket system is software meant typically for help desk professionals and said software is used to process and monitor customers/client issues from the moment they come in until they manage to get some form of a resolution.

With this in mind, we are going to use Microsoft Azure (a cloud computing platform created and managed by Microsoft that provides various services online). If you hadn't already made an account, go ahead and do so.

Once you have logged in you will have to make a Resource Group. A resource group in Microsoft Azure is simply a container that holds resources/services such as virtual machines, web apps, databases, and more. It's important for staying organized and more important for dividing and protecting certain resources from different departments of companies.

Going off from that point, we will need to create a Resource Group which is where we will put our virtual machine. Now, similar to my VirtualBox tutorial, a virtual machine is an operating system created using software on one physical computer in order to emulate the functionality of another separate physical computer. Azure does this by having their own servers and systems that do this for us.
